        <h2>My Photography Journey</h2>
        <hr>
        
        <P>My interests for photography began my freshman 
            year of high school when I got my first DSLR 
            as a gift. It was a <b>Canon Rebel T6</b>. A few 
            years later I upgraded to a <b>Canon EOS RP</b>, a 
            mirrorless body, which is my current camera. I 
            treat photography purely as a hobby, as what
            makes photography fun for me is the freedom
            to take pictures of whatever I want.
        </P>

        <p>Here are a few of my favorite photos I 
            have taken with this camera
        </p>

        <img src="surfer.jpg" alt="Surfer at the beach" height="300">
        <img src="galaxy.jpg" alt="Milky Way Galaxy" height="300">
        <img src="Waterfall.JPG" alt="Yosemite Waterfall" height="300">

        <p>I enjoy to shoot a very wide range of subjects 
            and activites, anything from sunsets to cars, 
            or even animals. 
        </p>

        <p>I also just recently got a drone to further 
            my interests in photography. My drone is a 
            <b>DJI Air-2s</b>, and I am currently working 
            towards receiving my Part-107 License from 
            the FAA to be able to pilot commerically 
            if I ever want to.

        <img src="coast.jpg" alt="Huntington Beach Shoreline" height="300">
        <img src="street.jpg" alt="Main St Huntington Beach Pier" height="300">

        <p>I am also very interested in videography
            and cinema production, and want to become
            more proficient in that field as well. Except
            videography is a whole different animal compared
            to photography, and will take some time and effort
            to master.
