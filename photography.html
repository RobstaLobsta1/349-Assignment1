    <h2>My Photography Journey</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      My interests for photography began my freshman year of high school when I
      got my first DSLR as a gift. It was a <u>Canon Rebel T6</u>. A few years
      later I upgraded to a <b>Canon EOS RP</b>, a mirrorless body, which is my
      current camera. I treat photography purely as a hobby, as what makes
      photography fun for me is the freedom to take pictures of whatever I want.

    <aside>
      I enjoy to shoot a very wide range of subjects and activites, anything
      from sunsets to cars, or even animals.

      I also just recently got a drone to further my interests in photography.
      My <del>drone</del> <ins>UAS</ins> is a <b>DJI Air-2s</b>, and I
      <s>am currently working towards my</s> have received my Part-107 License
      from the FAA to be able to pilot commerically if I ever want to.

      I am also very interested in videography and cinema production, and want
      to become more proficient in that field as well. Except videography is a
      whole different animal compared to photography, and will take some time
      and effort to master.
